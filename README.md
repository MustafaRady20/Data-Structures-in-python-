# Data structures are fundamental concepts of computer science which help in writing efficient programs
# in any programming language 

# python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language using which we can study
# the fundamentals of data structure in a simpler way as compared to other programming languages.


# Data Strucutre types 
- the various data structures in computer science are divided broadly into two categories shown below.

## Linear Data structure 
- these are the data structures which store the data elements in a sequential manner.

### Array 
- it's a sequential arrengment of the data elements paired with the index of the data element.
-
### Linked List
- each data element contains a link to another element along with the data present in it.
-
### stack
- it's a data structure which follows only to specific order of operation (LIFO) last in first out or (FILO) first in last out
-
### queue 
- it's similar to the stack but the order of operations is only FIFO (first in first out)
-
### Matrix
- It is two dimensional data structure in which the data element is referred by a pair of indices.

## non-linear Data structures

- These are the data structures in which there is no sequential linking of data elements. Any pair or group of data elements can be linked - to each other and can be accessed without a strict sequence

### Binary tree 
- it is a data structure where each element can be connected to maximum two other elements and it starts with the root node.
-
### Heap 
- It is a special case of Tree data structure where the data in the parent node is either strictly greater than/ equal to the child nodes - or strictly less than it’s child nodes.
- 
### Hash Table 
- It is a data structure which is made of arrays associated with each other using a hash function.
- It retrieves values using keys rather than index from a data element.

### Graph 
- It is an arrangement of vertices and nodes where some of the nodes are connected to each other through links.

# Python Specific Data Structures

## These data structures are specific to python language and they give greater flexibility in storing different types of data and faster   processing in python environment.

- List − It is similar to array with the exception that the data elements can be of different data types. You can have both numeric and  string data in a python list.
  
- Tuple − Tuples are similar to lists but they are immutable which means the values in a tuple cannot be modified they can only be read.

- Dictionary − The dictionary contains Key-value pairs as its data elements.
